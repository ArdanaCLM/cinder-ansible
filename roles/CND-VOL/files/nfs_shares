# The file referenced in the nfs_shares_config configuration option should contain
# the NFS exports in the ip:/share format, for example:

#10.63.165.215:/nfs/test
#10.63.165.215:/nfs2/test2

# where ip corresponds to the IP address assigned to a Data LIF, and share refers
# to a junction path for a FlexVol volume within an SVM. Make sure that volumes
# corresponding to exports have read/write permissions set on the ONTAP controllers.
# Do not put mount options in the nfs_shares_config file; use nfs_mount_options
